Under the Dog Control Act 1996, dog owners are required to:
- Register their dog with their local council and microchip it as required
- Keep their dogs under control at all times
- Take all reasonable steps to ensure their dogs do not injure or intimidate people or animals
- Ensure that their dog has food, water and shelter.

Everyone can take steps to avoid risky situations around dogs. To see how, start with [8 Simple Safety Tips](/under-construction/).

Most incidents happen at home, usually to children and usually by a dog that is familiar to the person injured. It’s especially important therefore to supervise children around dogs, and when children are old enough, to teach them sensible dog safety rules.

If:
- You have young children, you should know about [Keeping Children Safe](/under-construction/).
- You’d like to understand more about human / dog interactions, see [Dealing With Dogs](/under-construction/).
- You’ve got problems with a dog (or its owner), check out [Your Rights and Remedies](/under-construction/).
- You’d like guidelines for considerate behaviour for dog owners and everyone else, see [our Good Behaviour Tips](/under-construction/).
